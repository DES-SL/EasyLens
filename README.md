# EasyLens
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DES-SL/EasyLens.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DES-SL/EasyLens)

Enabling simple gravitational lens modeling in the browser, using IPython notebooks and extended source modeling code adapted from Birrer et al (2015).

For an introduction to the lens modeling library method, check out [Birrer et al (2015)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07629). EasyLens has an IPython Notebook "worksheet," that walks you through the lens modeling process. All images are assumed to be in *color*, which is to say that images in all available bandpasses are used.

## [Try it yourself!](https://github.com/DES-SL/EasyLens/blob/issue/4/worksheet/notebooks/ExampleWorksheet.ipynb)

The above link shows you the example worksheet IPython notebook. To run it, you will need to *fork* this repository, and clone it to your local machine. Then, do
```
python setup.py install
```
in a terminal window, from the top level directory. This will put all the EasyLens python code on your PYTHONPATH.
