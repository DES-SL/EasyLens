# EasyLens

Enabling simple gravitational lens modeling in the browser using IPython notebooks and Simon Birrer's code.

For an introduction to the lens modeling library method, check out the [Birrer et al (2015)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07629). EasyLens is an IPython Notebook "worksheet," that walks you through the lens modeling process. All images are assumed to be in *color*, which is to say that images in all available bandpasses are used.

## Try it yourself!

An IPython Notebook will appear here shortly!
